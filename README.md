# hosts-generator-from-domain
A simple app, written in python, which generates hosts from domains, by writing localhost before each line. These hosts can be used for blocklists in ad blocker apps, for example


USAGE:
There must be only 1 domain in one line. For example:
domain1.com
domain2.com

If you finished entering the domains, hit Enter. The program should run, and your result shall be like this:
0.0.0.0 domain1.com
0.0.0.0 domain2.com


please note that this is my first project and i'm a very beginner, and i initially created this program for my purposes, thee reasons why i post it on github are, in order:
1. I want to create an android application from it
2. I thought why not share it to the public
